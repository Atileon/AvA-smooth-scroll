# Scroll Smoot by AvA

This is just a little simple function to scroll from an element to an each other 

```javascript
    avaScroll(element,target);
```
Where the element and target must be passed selected by id

for newbies (like me once)
i.e.
```javascript
let element = document.getElementById('id');
```
